# holbertonschool-zero_day

This is just my very first repository, 
ever; 
yes.

Built using vagrant with a linux VM on a command promt in Windows.

Used to store the files created as part of my first project.

Amazed on how simple it was to do after **understanding** how to do it.
looking forward to this learning path with Holbertonschool.

**My very first day**

*but not my first day coding*

**edit from Github's interface**
